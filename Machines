1// Open Doors
How Many ports under 1000 opened in the targets 
Target IP: 35.156.4.248
flag md5(ports)
--- it so easy to solve this challenge, you will just use nmap to scan the target, use 'nmap 35.156.4.248 -p-' to scan all the port, than select the port under 1000, count the number of port you will find 2 , than use the md5 hash, you can use online website or your kali linux machine with the command 'echo -n 2|md5sum' you will find the flag : --- c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c ---

2// hiden
Can you find the hidden directory on the target web app
Target IP: 3.67.198.136
flag just directory name 
---
First of all scan the target 3.67.198.136 with nmap you can see the port 80 is open. Now you know that we must find the hidden directory, so we use a bruteforce tools( dirb, dirseaarch, Gobuster....) to do Bruteforce the directories. For example we will use dirb so we use the command 'dirb http://3.67.198.136 ', so we find the hidden file is secret so the flag is :
---secret ---
---

3// remote-CVE
Whatâ€™s CVE ID could be used against the web application in the below target
Target IP1: 18.159.248.180
Target IP2: 3.120.249.68
Flag format CVE-xxxx-xxxx
---
To solve this challenge, you can began with an nmap scan, try to scan all ports with the command nmap 18.159.248.180 -Pn -sV -p - 
After that we will use a kali lunix tool, it is searchsploit , whit this tool we can look for a sploit, well try to search for many think and when you look for HttpFileServer, you will find an exploit 
To do that just use the synthaxe searchsploit HttpFileServer  , after that you will see the number of the file, use the command searchsploit -m number_of_file, then cat the file
you will see the CVE number. So the flag is: 
---CVE-2014-6287---
---

4//INSIDE
Something here inside can you catch it 
---
First of all try to access to the website, hop you can't do that, after that try to scan the ip adress, well may be you don't find anything at the first time but try nmap -p- -Pn 18.185.92.165
You will find the port 3333 open, well if you use nmap -p- -Pn 18.185.92.165 -sV ( to view the the type and don't ping and scan all port) you know that the http it autorized in the port 3333, try to go to the website to this port http://18.185.92.165:3333, hopa you find the website 
Try to bruteforce all directories (transversal directorie, you can use dirb or gobuster) 
You will find the path http://18.185.92.165/cgi-bin/status. 
For this vulnirability we use Shellshock ( for learn more you can read this https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(faille_informatique))
To know how to use it read this (https://github.com/opsxcq/exploit-CVE-2014-6271)
The command is :  curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /home/inside'" \ http://18.185.92.165:3333/cgi-bin/status

the flag: ---  FLAG{InSiDe_ShOcK_WaVe_StAy_HoMe_StAy_SaFe}---
