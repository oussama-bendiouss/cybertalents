---They are two methodes (that i know), the first it's to use the inspector of your browser, than red the source code you will find in the html code a user and password for support (user:support password:x34245323); use it you are now connect like a support,now you can either use the inspector go to Storage and Cookies than change the value support to admin , and refrech the page and you will have the flag, or use firfox extensions, cookies-editor , but in the two case you will find the same flag: hiadminyouhavethepower---

2//This is Sparta:
---First of all you must use the inspector , and try to read this code .
you will see two script , the second script is encoded in ascii-hexa , you can use this website to decoded http://ddecode.com/hexdecoder/
after that you can read your code and it's clear that you have a list with five elements , and a if else condition bloc, you can read it and undertand that password = username = Cyber-Talent

4###Iam Legend
If I am a legend, then why am I so lonely? Flag Format : FLAG{} Link:http://35.193.45.56/iamlegend/
First of all open the inspector and read the code; you can focus on the script;he is a big code with a JSFUCK obfuscation, it is a code written with just 6 character []()+! , so it's a code but it's written with 6 character to be difficult to understand it;
You can use the website https://filipemgs.github.io/poisonjs/ to decode the code (notice that you mast be carful to space); 
than you will find you javascript code with the function check , and after read it you will understand (user = Cyber , pass = Talent); and you will find the flag : {J4V4_Scr1Pt_1S_S0_D4MN_FUN}");}

5 ###Searching for the cookie
simple search website we need to know which cookie to eat ;)Link:http://34.77.37.110/searching-cookie/
---
First of all open the inspector and try to read the code; 
After that we know, XSS attack is based to add a javascript code to an input form, so we try to use <script>alert('1')</script>, 
but when we see the sorce code we know that they are a filter; 
but if we read the script in head , we can see that we can closed the first script, so we use </script><script>alert("A");</script>, but at this moment they work,
or the challenge it's about which cookies we must eat so we use </script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script> and you see the flag :    coolcookie112

 6###bean
 Come back home Mr Bean .Link:http://52.28.216.196/bean/
 ---
 first of all try to read the code in the inspector, but you won't find anything, will you know that you must find a file or a derectory so try to access to home or admin but you won't find anything;
 Move to other methods, Firstly, We need to start with directory brute-force using dirsearch you can dowload it here: https://github.com/maurosoria/dirsearch; after that use this command  "python3 dirsearch.py -u 52.28.216.196/bean/", well may be he don't work so try with "py dirsearch.py -u 52.28.216.196/bean/", after that you will see a accessible file in /files ;try an Letâ€™s try [nginx alias_traversal] you will learn more about it:https://github.com/yandex/gixy/blob/master/docs/en/plugins/aliastraversal.md, 
 so go to :http://52.28.216.196/bean/files../home/  and you will find the flag of the challenge : FLAG{Nginx_nOt_aLWays_sEcUre_bY_The_waY}

7#Maximum Courage
Max prefers to learn by practicing and not just reading all day, so he set up a webserver and hopes it stays secret, can you prove it has a weakness?Link:http://3.126.138.80/maximum/
---
first of all try to read the source code,you won't find anythings; than we well use the last script dirsearch, but it will be more easy for us to use kali linux for this challenge, so we use the command "dirb http://3.126.138.80/maximum/" so we can see the file .git and the index.php;
Try with index.php but you won't find anything, so clone the .git with the command "wget -r http://3.126.138.80/maximum/.git/", than try to read each file;
After that use "git status" to see if some file is modified soon, well you will see that flag.php is modified, write  "git restore flag.php", than you can see the flag: be607453caada6a05d00c0ea0057f733

8### The Restricted Sessions
Flag is restricted to logged users only , can you be one of them.Link:http://34.77.37.110/restricted-sessions/
---well like we do all time we begin by using inspector and tryiny to understandind the code and check if they are some script or special things in the source code, we can see the script in the bottom of the page so we try to see if they are a cookie, but we don't find . Use Burp, with the repeater you send a cookie with this line : "cookie : PHPSESSID =admin " and we try with different value but we have a message "Session not found in data/session_store.txt" , try to go to the "http://34.77.37.110/restricted-sessions/data/session_store.txt"
you will find
"iuqwhe23eh23kej2hd2u3h2k23
11l3ztdo96ritoitf9fr092ru3
ksjdlaskjd23ljd2lkjdkasdlk" 
try to enter one of them as a value of cookie , try one after one nd you will see a message that Userinfo it's not correct, so no try to send a post request to know what is in the "getcurrentuserinfo.php", so you can use this request in the reapeter "POST /restricted-sessions/getcurrentuserinfo.php?PHPSESSID=iuqwhe23eh23kej2hd2u3h2k23 HTTP/1.1"
You will receive an answer like this = "{"name":"john","email":.......}" the must impotant value is name, now we send it with the cookie like a userInfo value , "cookie:  PHPSESSID=iuqwhe23eh23kej2hd2u3h2k23;UserInfo=john"
you will find the flag :  sessionareawesomebutifitsecure

9### Newsletter
the administrator put the backup file in the same root folder as the application, help us download this backup by retrieving the backup file name
Link:http://18.192.3.151/newsletter/
---
First of all read the source code, after that because we are in an injection challenge, try to find all the input, you will find an input mail , enter a mail and you will see Your email inserted successfully. Try to put with your mail ;ls; , so we have 'a@a.a; ls;' try to inject this and you will find the backup file, well we use ls because we know that ls is a linux command to show all the file in a directory. 
the fag is :  ---hgdr64.backup.tar.gz---

A famous enterprise blog was hacked, can you figure out how it was hacked?
Link:http://ec2-35-158-236-11.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/hashable/
---
we know that we are in an injection challenge, so let's try a simple injection, well we will use burp suite, first of all we search for some where to put a code , so we find the contact me. 
TRy to send a message and send the request to repeater. So try to add ;ls; to your message you will see an error that we use the eval function, it syntaxe is eval(something here ,your data from message input field ,something here ).
try to put test");echo test;//, ohhh it works, now inject your code test");system('ls');//  or use ;${system('ls')}, after that we see all directory now cat the flag file to see the flag , use the injection test;$system('cat flag_23894ABCX1.txt')} 
we find the flag ---18ab51f960bd149bcb2497b9998c752c---

11### Easy access
Only superpower makes you see unlimited view.
Link:http://ec2-35-158-236-11.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/easy-access/
--- well first of all read the source code, you will find a username and a password , try it (bob , password), but it is not the good solution.
You know that we are in a sql injection challenge, so let's try a simple sql injection, put ' in the password and username, you will receive a message from the database, so now we are sure there is an sql injection vulnerability, let's try :  'or'1'='1, but it dosn't work, but we now that only admin have access
Try admin'or '1'='1     , after that you well have the flag: ---flag{!njection_3v3ry_wh3r3}---
