First of all open the inspector and read the code; you can focus on the script;he is a big code with a JSFUCK obfuscation, it is a code written with just 6 character []()+! , so it's a code but it's written with 6 character to be difficult to understand it;
You can use the website https://filipemgs.github.io/poisonjs/ to decode the code (notice that you mast be carful to space); 
than you will find you javascript code with the function check , and after read it you will understand (user = Cyber , pass = Talent); and you will find the flag : {J4V4_Scr1Pt_1S_S0_D4MN_FUN}");}

5 ###Searching for the cookie
simple search website we need to know which cookie to eat ;)Link:http://34.77.37.110/searching-cookie/
---
First of all open the inspector and try to read the code; 
After that we know, XSS attack is based to add a javascript code to an input form, so we try to use <script>alert('1')</script>, 
but when we see the sorce code we know that they are a filter; 
but if we read the script in head , we can see that we can closed the first script, so we use </script><script>alert("A");</script>, but at this moment they work,
or the challenge it's about which cookies we must eat so we use </script><script>alert(document.cookie);</script> and you see the flag :    coolcookie112
