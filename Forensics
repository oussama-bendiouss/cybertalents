###1//linuxcmd-101

In this challenge you will learn a lot about linux commande.
 _ First of all you must download the zip and put it in you kali linux machine
 _ Then you must extract the file. Well your file have .tar.gz as a extention, to extract the file you must use  "gzip -d linux-chal.tar.gz" and after that use "tar -xf linux-chal.tar "
 _ Now you have your directory , you will find one hidden file and one directory, use "ls -a" to see it, than cat it with "cat .pass.txt", now you have the password try to unzip the directory, you can use "7z  x exec.zip" and enter the password "qwerty1245"
 _ After that you will have one zip file and another file his name is '-', just excute it, to do that you must giving it the executable permission, use "chmod +x -", than excute it with the cmd "./-" and you will see the password  
 _ Now unzip the next file with the same methode and the new password "998877665544332211". 
 _ Now, you must start by identify the type of files using "file *", and you can se one different file, cat it and you will find the new password, it's the file f6 and the password is "rryuiytqpyuiqyofdkhsjhfewojnhfdss".
 _ Unzip the next directory, and try to see if some of the file have a relation with the name of the size37 directory, use "ls -l" and you will see the test5 their size is exactly 37KB so he contain the pÃ¢ssword and the pass is "62094n902m2x-28mx4t9xy282y49ty9824yt"
 _ You have a file with the name nexttocybertalents, so try to cat it and you will find a lot of data, so search if we have cybertalents in some places use "cat nexttocybertalents| grep cybertalents" so the file name is nexttocybertalents so the password is the second part of the word cybertalentsorderby1337 so the pass is "orderby1337"
 _ Unzip the next fiel with th last pass, and we well use zip2john tools ["Zip2john" is a tool with what we can extract the hash of the zip password and use a dictionary which contains a lot of possibility passwords and if among them there are the right password they say it to you]. So use the cmd "zip2john decodeme1.zip| tee a" after that use "john a --wordlist= ./One" and you will find the password is "infrastructure"
 _ Now unzip the file, cat the pass file you will find "dXNlbWVhc3Bhc3N3b3Jk" it is encoded by base64 code, so you must decode, you can use "https://www.base64decode.org/" it is a online website to do that, and you will find the pass", or use the cmd in the linux "base64 -d pass" and you will find the pass "usemeaspassword"
 _ Now unzip the last file, you find the flag file cat it and you will find "synt{f1zcyr_yvahk_101}",  but the flag is encrypted with rot13 encryption using command"cat flag.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'" you can reverse the encryption and get the original flag 
   
   the flag is:                     --- flag{s1mple_linux_101} ---
