In this challenge you will learn a lot about linux commande.
 _ First of all you must download the zip and put it in you kali linux machine
 _ Then you must extract the file. Well your file have .tar.gz as a extention, to extract the file you must use  "gzip -d linux-chal.tar.gz" and after that use "tar -xf linux-chal.tar "
 _ Now you have your directory , you will find one hidden file and one directory, use "ls -a" to see it, than cat it with "cat .pass.txt", now you have the password try to unzip the directory, you can use "7z  x exec.zip" and enter the password "qwerty1245"
 _ After that you will have one zip file and another file his name is '-', just excute it, to do that you must giving it the executable permission, use "chmod +x -", than excute it with the cmd "./-" and you will see the password  
 _ Now unzip the next file with the same methode and the new password "998877665544332211".
