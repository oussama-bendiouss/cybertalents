1// A hacker leaked the below hash online.Can you crack it to know the password of the CEO? 1ab566b9fa5c0297295743e7c2a6ec27: 
---will in this situation, we must know the length of the code  (32element = MD5) ,(40element =SHA-1), (56 elements =SHA-2); 
you can use this website "www.dcode.fr", or the simple way it's write the hash in google and he will give you the reverse; 
for this question the solutions is : Iamtheflag

2// A hacker leaked the below hash online.Can you crack it to know the password of the CEO? the flag is the password Hash: 06f8aa28b9237866e3e289f18ade19e1736d809d:

3//we got this corrupted hash password from a Pcap file with a note (password = sha-1(hash-result)).
HASH:77be5d24ed2e3e590045e1d6o7e84i50d2799c19f48ede46804a8734e287df120f 
---First of all you count the number of element in your code you will find 67 and that it is not possible;
So move to see if they are something in your code that shoudn't exist;
you will see a 'i' and a 'o' because we know in a hash we have number from 0 to 9 and character from a to f , so we delete the 'i' and the 'o';
Than we can put it in the web we  can see that is a md5 hash , after a reverse hash we find the code s3cr3tpassword;
but the flag is the sha-1 of the hash so we find the flag : 83874343435092cb681c0d558a84bfeb389c32ed

*first of all to past this challenge you must use either Firefox or Burp suite , for us we will use Firefox, open the inspector and than read the code you will see a password and username , it's Guest et Guest , use it and  you will see a message that tell you , it is not  the adminstrator account 
*move to storage in Firefox  you will see a cookies with name Authentification and with a value = bG9naW49R3Vlc3Q%3D, it's clear it is a 64encode, use this website to decode https://www.base64decode.net/, and than you will see login=Guest7, change it to login=admin, and decode it with this website https://www.base64encode.net/, you will find bG9naW49YWRtaW4=  
*than put it instead of the old expression and refresh the page and you will find the flag :      FLag{B@D_4uTh1Nt1C4Ti0n}
